      ICC Champions Trophy 2025 was played in a hybrid model.
      Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi thanked his team for successfully hosting the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the country and called it a "historic event for cricket fans worldwide". The Champions Trophy was played in a hybrid model after the Indian government denied sending Rohit Sharma-led side to the neighbouring nation citing players' safety.
      
      One of the semifinal matches featuring India was hosted by Dubai and the rest of the tournament was played in Pakistan's Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi. The final of the marquee event was also hosted by Dubai as India qualified for the title decider.

      It was Pakistan's first major ICC tournament after last co-hosting the 1996 ODI World Cup with India and Sri Lanka.
      
      
      "I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the dedicated PCB team, the vigilant law enforcement agencies, the supportive provincial governments, the esteemed ICC officials, and the phenomenal cricket teams that traveled to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy 2025. Your commitment and collective efforts ensured the seamless execution of this prestigious tournament, transforming it into a resounding success," Naqvi wrote on X on Monday.
      
      "Pakistan takes immense pride in hosting this global spectacle, and your contributions have truly made it a historic event for cricket fans worldwide," he added.
      
      
      Rohit Sharma-led India defeated New Zealand by five wickets to clinch the title. Rohit Sharma was awarded Player of the Match in final after scoring 76 runs. On the other hand, defending champions and host Pakistan had a forgetful campaign as they failed to register a single win in the mega event.
